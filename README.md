## Function checklist
* Did you start your function definition with def?
* Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
* Did you put an open parenthesis *"("* right after the function name?
* Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis *"("* separated by commas?
* Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicate names).
* Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon *"):"* after the arguments?
* Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function 4 spaces? No more, no less
* Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?

## Using a function checklist
* Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
* Did you put "*(*" character after the name to run it?
* Did you put the valeus you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
* Did you end the function call with a "*)*" character?
